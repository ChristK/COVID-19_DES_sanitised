# COVID-19 Demand DES
Discrete Event Simulation for planning health care demand during the COVID-19 pandemic

## Notes
This is a simple Discrete Event Simulation model that was developed in R using the R package [simmer](https://r-simmer.org/). Its purpose it to accept the output of a COVID-19 transmission model and estimate the number of hospital beds (level 1, ICU) that may be required over time. 

Note that all inputs for this model are currently random numbers. For this model to produce any meaningful results, the user has to update the inputs.

This model was developed by Chris Kypridemos, with contributions from Alex Alexiou, and Roberta Piroddi at the Univeristy of Liverpool.
